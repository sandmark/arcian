# ArCian

ArCian is a simple key remapping tool based on [Interception](https://github.com/oblitum/Interception), created as a replacement for the buggy Synapse that comes with Razer Tartarus V2.

## Installation

Download from [releases](https://github.com/sandmark/arcian/releases).

## Usage

Simply double-click `arcian.exe`.

Make sure that the .exe file, `interception.dll`, and `settings.edn` are placed in the same directory.
An example `settings.edn` can be found [here](https://github.com/sandmark/arcian/example_settings.edn).
